⚠️  Installation verification had issues

============================================================
📋 Next Steps
============================================================

1. Activate the environment:
   conda activate mls

2. Start the MLS services:
   python launcher.py

3. Or start services individually:
   python -m server.communications.manager
   python -m server.Flask.flask_server
   python -m server.cam.camera_server

4. Access the dashboard:
   http://localhost:5000

5. In VS Code:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P
   - Type 'Python: Select Interpreter'
   - Choose 'mls' environment
   - Use F5 to run with debugging

6. VS Code Tasks (Ctrl+Shift+P -> 'Run Task'):
   - Start All Services (Launcher)
   - Start Manager
   - Start Flask Server
   - Run Tests
   - Format Code (Black)
